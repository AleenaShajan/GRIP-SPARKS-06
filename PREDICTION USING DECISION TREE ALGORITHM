Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm


Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox


Objective : To create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
     ‚óè The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
     
     

Steps involved in this task : 
  1)IMPORTING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES
  2)LOADING AND READING THE DATASET
  3)FEATURE EXPLORATION
  4)CORRELATION MATRIX
  5)DATA VISUALIZATION
  6)DATA PRE-PROCESSING
  7)TRAINING THE MODEL AND DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTES AND LABELS
  8)CLASSIFICATION REPORT AND CONFUSION MATRIX
  9)VISUALIZATION OF TRAINED MODEL
 10)CONCLUSION
 
 

PROJECT BASED CONCLUSION : 
  1.For each attritubes 4 pairplots have been plotted with respect to other.
  2.Both the train and test data has been splitted inorder to minimize the effects of data discrepancies and better understand the model.
  3.The prediction was calculated using decision tree algorithm.
  4.A Decision Tree Classifier has been created and based on that accuracy of the classification report was evaluated as 1.
  5.The visually represented Decision Tree Classifier consists of 1 node and 18 branches.
